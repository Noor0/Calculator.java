in the paint program there's a bug the circle overlaps every other shape it's because in the function circles are printed in the last but im just too lazy to edit the code myself

in spelling checker there's a function which tries to predict the correct word assuming that you have missed a letter while typing the word that function is not working properly everything other than that is fine and the program shows repeated words because alot of words are being repeated in the dict.txt file
